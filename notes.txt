## TODO

* Rate limit
* deal with keys
* add correct answer if nobody won (?)
* create engine for valid answers (xof -> all three must be diff)
* user error when winning two times in a row -> status is duplicate
* check what happens when nobody replied
* add error handling (rop?)

## REVIEW


## DONE

* Paket
* GV : create a twitter for the bot
* fill the Twitter code with actual code to Twitter
  post a tweet
  grab answers to a tweet
  ! CAREFUL WITH THE TWITTER RATE LIMIT
* wrap question creation -> post to Twitter in 'something'
* fsi file for core (GV)
* check status.Id (GV)
* check: does the capital actually exist? ex Macao has no capital (GV)
* create a TopShelf host (check out steps, console app -> quizbot proj)
* how are we going to separate multiple choice from single
* create unwrap for Participant (GV)
* design for common format across data sources for questions
* fix announcing winner with '@username' instead of 'username'
* create engine for normalizing participant answers
* add correct answer when somebody won

## Notes

! careful: publishing keys, deploying bot (AppVeyor?) (Fake deploy?)

Bot

Multiple choices?
Single choice?
Closest answer : 'what is the pop of Belgium?' (within margin)
Exact answer: 'what is the capital of Belgium?'
? What is the country from 4 with largest population

Winner = first correct, or closest within timeframe

Exact? 'Brussels', 'Bruxelles', "brUSSELs', 'Brussel', 'burssels'
'fuzzy string matching' : edit distance / Levenhstein distance (more generally string distance)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

? hint

Bot creates question with known answer
Bot posts question, with time limit
People respond
Bot pulls responses
Bot finds winner
If no winner, Bot suggests hint -> extra time
Bot finds winner
Bot announces winner, or correct answer if no winner?

// parallel: Bot publishes top scores / ranking, say, every hour

Bot responds to commands asking for ranking etc...
