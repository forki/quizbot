Bot

Multiple choices?
Single choice?
Closest answer : 'what is the pop of Belgium?' (within margin)
Exact answer: 'what is the capital of Belgium?'
? What is the country from 4 with largest population

Winner = first correct, or closest within timeframe

[20:03:05] Gien Verschatse: ParticipantResponse?
[20:03:29] Mathias Brandewinder: yeah - or Guess?

Exact? 'Brussels', 'Bruxelles', "brUSSELs', 'Brussel', 'burssels'
'fuzzy string matching' : edit distance / Levenhstein distance (more generally string distance)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

? hint

Bot creates question with known answer
Bot posts question, with time limit
People respond
Bot pulls responses
Bot finds winner
If no winner, Bot suggests hint -> extra time
Bot finds winner
Bot announces winner, or correct answer if no winner?

// parallel: Bot publishes top scores / ranking, say, every hour

Bot responds to commands asking for ranking etc...
